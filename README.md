# ParticleTest
Testing the library add function in the Particle IDE.
The required files are: repo with public clone URL, a JSON manifest (particle.json) at the root of the repo, a bunch of files and directories at predictable locations (header, cpp, ino, etc.)

Don't forget to bring a towel!

Closing issues.
